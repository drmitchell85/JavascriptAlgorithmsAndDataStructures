# Section 22: Binary Search Trees
Trees are data structures of nodes with parent / child relationships

Trees are nonlinear

Root is the top node of the tree
Child is directly connected to another when moving away from the root
Parent is the converse of a child
Sibling has the same parent
Leaf has no children
Edge is the connection between two nodes

## Examples:
HTML DOM
Network Routing
Abstract Syntax Tree
AI/ML

## Binary Search Trees:
each parent node has at most two children
every node to the left of the parent is always less than the parent
every node to the right of the parent is always greater than the parent

## Why these are used
easy to search, every search effectively chops things in half
